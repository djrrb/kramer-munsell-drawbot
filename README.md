# Munsell color grid

This is a first try of doing a grid of munsell colors for John. Run `colorGrid.py` in drawbot, making sure it stays in the same local folder as the other files, which it calls on.

There are three values in XyY > RGB conversion, so we have three dimensions: 
* x = X (between 0 and 1)
* y = y (between 0 and 1)
* the number of pages = Y (between 1 and 255)

I donâ€™t know much about what these values mean yet, so this really just play.
